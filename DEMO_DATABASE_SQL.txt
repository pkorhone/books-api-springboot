("The Algebraist", "A superb standalone novel from the awesome imagination of Iain M. Banks, a master of modern science fiction. It is 4034 AD. Humanity has made it to the stars. Fassin Taak, a Slow Seer at the Court of the Nasqueron Dwellers, will be fortunate if he makes it to the end of the year. The Nasqueron Dwellers inhabit a gas giant on the outskirts of the galaxy, in a system awaiting its wormhole connection to the rest of civilisation. In the meantime, they are dismissed as decadents living in a state of highly developed barbarism, hoarding data without order, hunting their own young and fighting pointless formal wars. Seconded to a military-religious order he's barely heard of - part of the baroque hierarchy of the Mercatoria, the latest galactic hegemony - Fassin Taak has to travel again amongst the Dwellers. He is in search of a secret hidden for half a billion years. But with each day that passes a war draws closer - a war that threatens to overwhelm everything and everyone he's ever known. As complex, turbulent and spectacular as the gas giant on which it is set, this novel from Iain M. Banks is space opera on a truly epic scale. Praise for Iain M.

For one man it means a desperate flight, and a search for the one - maybe two - people who could clear his name. For his brother it means a life lived under constant threat of treachery and murder. And for their sister, even without knowing the full truth, it means returning to a place she'd thought abandoned forever. Only the sister is not what she once was; Djan Seriy Anaplian has changed almost beyond recognition to become an agent of the Culture's Special Circumstances section, charged with high-level interference in civilizations throughout the greater galaxy. Concealing her new identity - and her particular set of abilities - might be a dangerous strategy, however. In the world to which Anaplian returns, nothing is quite as it seems; and determining the appropriate level of interference in someone else's war is never a simple matter.

It is, truly, the End Days for the Gzilt civilisation. An ancient people, organised on military principles and yet almost perversely peaceful, the Gzilt helped set up the Culture ten thousand years earlier and were very nearly one of its founding societies, deciding not to join only at the last moment. Now they've made the collective decision to follow the well-trodden path of millions of other civilisations: they are going to Sublime, elevating themselves to a new and almost infinitely more rich and complex existence. Amid preparations though, the Regimental High Command is destroyed. Lieutenant Commander (reserve) Vyr Cossont appears to have been involved, and she is now wanted - dead, not alive. Aided only by an ancient, reconditioned android and a suspicious Culture avatar, Cossont must complete her last mission given to her by the High Command. She must find the oldest person in the Culture, a man over nine thousand years old, who might have some idea what really happened all that time ago. It seems that the final days of the Gzilt civilisation are likely to prove its most perilous.

Deep within a fabled labyrinth on a barren world, a Planet of the Dead proscribed to mortals, lay a fugitive Mind. Both the Culture and the Idirans sought it.

("Emperor", "Brilliant…stunning,” raved the Los Angeles Times about Conn Iggulden’s first novel, Emperor: The Gates of Rome. “Iggulden is a grand storyteller,” declared USA Today. Now Iggulden returns to the landscape of ancient Rome and the life of Julius Caesar in a new novel filled with all the sumptuous storytelling that distinguished his first book. Sweeping from the windswept, pirate-ruled seas to the stifling heat of the Roman senate, Iggulden takes us further down the path to glory as Julius Caesar comes into his own as a man, warrior, senator, husband, leader. In a sweltering, sparsely settled region of North Africa, a band of disheveled soldiers turn their eyes toward one man among them. Ragged, dirty, and half starved, the men will follow their leader into the mad, glorious fight for honor and revenge that only he wants to fight. Their leader is named Julius Caesar. The soldiers are Roman legionaries. And their quarry is a band of pirates who made the mistake of seizing Julius Caesar—and holding him for ransom. Now, to get his revenge, Caesar will turn peasants into soldiers, building a shipborne fighting force that will not only decimate a pirate fleet but will dominate the Mediterranean, earning him the coveted title Military Tribune of Rome. While Caesar builds a legend far from Rome, his friend Gaius Brutus is fighting battles of another sort, rising to power in the wake of the shocking assassination of a dictator. Once Brutus and Caesar were as close as brothers, both devoted to the same ideals and attracted to the same forbidden woman. Now, when Caesar returns—with the winds of glory at his back—they will find themselves at odds. For each has built an army of elite warriors—Caesar’s forged in far-flung battles, Brutus’ from Rome’s political killing fields. But in an era when men die for their treachery and their allegiances, the two men will soon be united by a shock wave from the north. There, a gladiator named Spartacus is gathering strength, building an army of seventy thousand desperate slaves—to fight a cataclysmic battle against Rome itself. Filled with unforgettable images—from the death throes of a king to the birth of Caesar’s child, from the bloody battlefields of Greece to the silent passion of lovers—Emperor: The Death of Kings is an astounding work, a stunning blend of vibrant history and thrilling fiction.

How did the contraceptive pill change the face of the legal profession? Why was the horse collar as important for human progress as the steam engine? How did the humble spreadsheet turn the world of finance upside-down? The world economy defies comprehension. A continuously-changing system of immense complexity, it offers over ten billion distinct products and services, doubles in size every fifteen years, and links almost every one of the planet's seven billion people. It delivers astonishing luxury to hundreds of millions. It also leaves hundreds of millions behind, puts tremendous strains on the ecosystem, and has an alarming habit of stalling. Nobody is in charge of it. Indeed, no individual understands more than a fraction of what's going on. How can we make sense of this bewildering system on which our lives depend? From the tally-stick to Bitcoin, the canal lock to the jumbo jet, each invention in Tim Harford's fascinating new book has its own curious, surprising and memorable story, a vignette against a grand backdrop. Step by step, readers will start to understand where we are, how we got here, and where we might be going next. Hidden connections will be laid bare: how the barcode undermined family corner shops; why the gramophone widened inequality; how barbed wire shaped America. We'll meet the characters who developed some of these inventions, profited from them, or were ruined by them. We'll trace the economic principles that help to explain their transformative effects.

("Messy", "“Utterly fascinating. Tim Harford shows that if you want to be creative and resilient, you need a little more disorder in your world.” —Adam Grant, New York Times-bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take “Engrossing.” —New York Times From the award-winning columnist and author of the national bestseller The Undercover Economist comes a provocative big idea book about the genuine benefits of being messy: at home, at work, in the classroom, and beyond. Look out for Tim's next book, Fifty Inventions That Shaped the Modern Economy. Messy: The Power of Disorder to Transform Our Lives celebrates the benefits that messiness has in our lives: why it’s important, why we resist it, and why we should embrace it instead. Using research from neuroscience, psychology, social science, as well as captivating examples of real people doing extraordinary things, Tim Harford explains that the human qualities we value – creativity, responsiveness, resilience – are integral to the disorder, confusion, and disarray that produce them. From the music studio of Brian Eno to the Lincoln Memorial with Martin Luther King, Jr., from the board room to the classroom, messiness lies at the core of how we innovate, how we achieve, how we reach each other – in short, how we succeed. In Messy, you’ll learn about the unexpected connections between creativity and mess; understand why unexpected changes of plans, unfamiliar people, and unforeseen events can help generate new ideas and opportunities as they make you anxious and angry; and come to appreciate that the human inclination for tidiness – in our personal and professional lives, online, even in children’s play – can mask deep and debilitating fragility that keep us from innovation. Stimulating and readable as it points exciting ways forward, Messy is an insightful exploration of the real advantages of mess in our lives.", "2016", "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sdCACwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", (SELECT author_id FROM author WHERE name = "Tim Harford"), (SELECT publisher_id FROM publisher WHERE name = "Penguin"));

It’s a story of love, betrayal, violence and death. Using the relationship between wards and their foster parents, the conflict between the social classes and Liberian educational, economic and social realities as background, Thomas lays bare the infected wounds on most Liberians. Many years after the founding of Liberia as an independent nation, an undercurrent of subjugation of wards flowed throughout the country as a right of passage toward education and civilization. Ironically, the once subjugated in America and Liberia became the subjugators. Those once oppressed became the oppressors, and this abnormally cut across social class and ethnic boundaries. Had everyone become a wounded ward? Worly finds himself a target of abuse, exploitation and restriction. His experience parallels Hne’s and others in many households of “civilized people.” His struggle to break through his shackles is a compelling drama. There are the Grinders whose implosion stems from corruption, betrayal and violence. Worly the ward emerges as the hero who saves Mrs. Grinder from strangulation at the hands of Mr. Grinder. There is Mr Hartman, the hypocrite whose lust results in his tragic death. Then there is Mr. Bookman, who is on the run to escape persecution for corruption.

("Behind That Curtain", "This early work by Earl Derr Biggers was originally published in 1928 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography. \"Behind That Curtain\" is set almost exclusively in California (as opposed to Chan's native Hawaii), and tells the story of the former head of Scotland Yard, a detective who is pursuing the long-cold trail of a murderer. Earl Derr Biggers was born on 26th August 1884 in Warren, Ohio, USA. Biggers received his further education at Harvard University, where he developed a reputation as a literary rebel, preferring the popular modern authors, such as Rudyard Kipling and Richard Harding Davis to the established figures of classical literature. Following in their footsteps upon graduating, he himself began a career as a popular writer, penning humorous articles and reviews for the Boston Traveler. While on holiday in Hawaii, Biggers heard tales of a real-life Chinese detective operating in Honolulu, named Chang Apana. This inspired him to create his most enduring legacy in the character of super-sleuth Charlie Chan. The first Chan story “The House Without a Key” (1925) was published as a serialised story in the Saturday Evening Post and then released as a novel in the same year. Biggers went on to write five more Chan novels and all were licensed for movie adaptations by Fox Films. These films were hugely popular with several different actors taking the lead role of Chan.

("Honored by Man-", "Honored By Man is an historical novel about the Trojan War. Epic in its scope, it utilizes the Greek and Trojan characters from Homers Iliad and the Gods who pulled their strings. Throughout history fragments of this tale have formed the cornerstone of drama and literature. Each piece engrossing enough to stand alone, mortared together they become majestic. Honored By Man utilizes all the known history, myth and poetry surrounding the Trojan War and tells the story from the Divine curses setting it in motion to the disgruntled homecomings of the few left alive. It is told from three vantagepoints: Greece, Troy, and Olympus. The cast of characters is an enormous gathering of heroes and heroines with the Gods larger than life. On the Greek side, Helen, with her sisters Timandra and Clytaemenstra, dominate the women; Achilles, Patrolcus, Odysseus, and Agamenmon lead the men. The Trojans are equally strong. The Queen Hecuba, her many daughters and Andromache are the main ladies while the suave Paris, noble Hector, smooth Deiphobus and steady Helenus are the leading men. The Gods play equally with the lives of everyone. The novel begins in Sparta with all the Kings of Greece gathered to try for Helens hand. The future heroes on the Greek side are introduced as well as the heroines. The action quickens with Paris introduction and subsequent abduction of Helen. With the scene switching back and forth from the Greek encampment to behind the Trojan fortress, ten long years of war follow culminating in the bloody sack of the city, and the few survivors heading homeward. Everyone knows the story; few know its entirety. Honored By Man breaths life and depth into the illustrious characters of Homer and weaves the threads of myth, poetry and history into a tapestry savored by all readers.", "2002", "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RloQLo18JzoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", (SELECT author_id FROM author WHERE name = "Bardy Quinlan Brown"), (SELECT publisher_id FROM publisher WHERE name = "Xlibris Corporation"));

("Tiempos recios", "LA NUEVA NOVELA DE MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, PREMIO NOBEL DE LITERATURA Una historia de conspiraciones políticas e intereses encontrados durante la Guerra Fría. Una mentira que pasó por verdad y cambió el devenir de América Latina. «¿Era la historia esa fantástica tergiversación de la realidad?» Guatemala, 1954. El golpe militar perpetrado por Carlos Castillo Armas y auspiciado por Estados Unidos a través de la CIA derroca el gobierno de Jacobo Árbenz. Detrás de este acto violento se encuentra una mentira que pasó por verdad y que cambió el devenir de América Latina: la acusación por parte del gobierno de Eisenhower de que Árbenz alentaba la entrada del comunismo soviético en el continente. Tiempos recios es una historia de conspiraciones internacionales e intereses encontrados, en los años de la Guerra Fría, cuyos ecos resuenan hasta la actualidad. Un suceso que involucró a varios países y en el que algunos verdugos acabaron convirtiéndose en víctimas de la misma trama que habían ayudado a construir. En esta novela apasionante, que conecta con la aclamada La Fiesta del Chivo, Mario Vargas Llosa funde la realidad con dos ficciones: la del narrador que libremente recrea personajes y situaciones, y la diseñada por aquellos que quisieron controlar la política y la economía de un continente manipulando su historia. Críticas: «La escritura de Mario Vargas Llosa ha dado forma a nuestra imagen de Sudamérica y tiene su propio capítulo en la historia de la literatura contemporánea. En sus primeros años, fue un renovador de la novela, hoy, un poeta épico.» Per Wastberg, presidente del Comité Nobel «Cinco Esquinas, la nueva novela de Mario Vargas Llosa, es un retrato del Perú de los años noventa, estremecido por la violencia de Sendero Luminoso, sacudido por la corrupción del gobierno de Fujimori y escandalizado por el periodismo sensacionalista.» Letras libres «Cinco Esquinas es una obra que Vargas Llosa ha escrito con malicia y con buen humor, vertiendo con maestría los trucos de su sabiduría narrativa, pero sin tomarse muy enserio ni a sí mismo ni a unos personajes verosímiles en su superficialidad.» Iñaki Ezquerra, Ideal de Almería «Pocos laberintos tan amenos y tan razonables como esta novela de Vargas Llosa.» José-Carlos Mainer, Babelia (sobre El héroe discreto) «Estas páginas dan cuenta de la manera extraordinaria en que Mario Vargas Llosa domina los misterios de la ficción y el arte de la novela, con un final tan sorprendente como maravilloso por inesperado.» Fernando R. Lafuente, ABC Cultural (sobre El héroe discreto) «Con El héroe discreto gozamos de la maestría a la que nos tiene acostumbrados el mejor Vargas Llosa.» J. A. Masoliver Ródenas, Cultura/s (La Vanguardia) «El sueño del celta reúne algunas de las mejores virtudes del escritor y se integra, además, en la estela de motivos temáticos fundamentales reiterados a lo largo de su obra.» Ricardo Senabre, El Cultural «Vargas Llosa no tiene rival. [...] He aquí el primer mérito de El sueño del celta: contar una historia como si todo fuera verdad escondiendo la mentira. El segundo mérito estriba en el dominio absoluto y constante del creador sobre su criatura.» Ricardo Baixeras, El Periódico «El sueño del celta dibuja, con los recursos de la ficción, los despiadados entresijos del poder y la fuerza de la individualidad [...]. La novela avanza envolvente, a ritmo impecable, y nos sumerge en una crónica sobrecogedora del despotismo, con unos personajes tan enraizados en su doliente y contradictoria humanidad que hacen de esta novela un gran regalo literario.» C. Méndez, Expansión «De nuevo en el mundo ficticio de Vargas Llosa se revela en toda su crudeza la verdad de las mentiras. Innecesarios los elogios.» J. A. Masoliver Ródenas, Cultura/s, La Vanguardia (sobre El sueño del celta) «Vargas Llosa ha vuelto a la novela histórica con el arte acumulado tras su ya extenso periplo literario. El resultado es un libro espléndido, de lo mejor que ha dado su innegable talento.» Joaquín Marco, El Cultural (sobre La Fiesta del Chivo) «El doctor Vargas Llosa ha escrito mucho más que la historia de una magnicidio [...]. Esta es la vuelta triunfal a su mejor literatura.» Javier Aparicio, El Periódico de Catalunya (sobre La Fiesta del Chivo) «Regresa a la que para muchos es su mejor etapa como escritor, la de las novelas de compleja construcción y amplio desarrollo que se inicia con La ciudad y los perros y se cierra con La guerra del fin del mundo.» J. A. Masoliver Ródenas, La Vanguardia (sobre La Fiesta del Chivo) «Pletórico de imaginación, técnica narrativa y altura de pensamiento, vuelve el mejor Mario Vargas Llosa con La Fiesta del Chivo, una feroz crítica de la tiranía impuesta por Trujillo a la República Dominicana y una excepcional novela sobre la corrupción que envuelve cualquier forma absolutista de ejercicio de poder.» Francisco García Pérez, La Nueva España", "2019", "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bZmlDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", (SELECT author_id FROM author WHERE name = "Mario Vargas Llosa"), (SELECT publisher_id FROM publisher WHERE name = "ALFAGUARA"));

("Fables de La Fontaine", "Jean de La Fontaine (1621-1695) est un poète de l'entourage de Nicolas Fouquet, surintendant des finances de Louis XIV. Avec la disgrâce de Nicolas Fouquet, Jean de La Fontaine se retrouve dépourvu de protecteur, c'est-à-dire de revenu assuré, ainsi que de toute espérance d'exercer ses talents à la cour du roi. Son talent cependant lui ouvre grandes les portes des salons et, malgré de nombreuses oppositions, il est reçu à l'Académie française.Le fait d'être à l'écart de la cour lui permettra d'exercer une légère irrévérence à l'égard du pouvoir royal dans ses fables.La renaissance a remis au gout du jour les oeuvres gréco-latines de l'antiquité. Parmi celles-ci les fables d'Esope ont fourni à Jean de La Fontaine une source importante d'inspiration. Le talent de Jean de La Fontaine a été de raconter celles-ci en vers, de donner un caractère humain à ses personnages voire de suggérer qu'ils pouvaient incarner les grands de la cour, et de conclure des fables par une morale : « je me sers d'animaux pour instruire les hommes. »Ecrites en vers, les fables de La Fontaine sont l'une des principales oeuvres poétiques de la littérature classique.La sagesse populaire s'est emparée de nombre de ces morales qui sont devenues des proverbes ou des expressions populaires.Notons que l'expression « tirer les marrons du feu » s'applique à celui qui fait tous les efforts alors que c'est un autre qui en tire le profit.

Fallon cannot live in peace until she frees those who have been preyed upon by the government or the fanatical Purity Warriors, endlessly hunted or locked up in laboratories, brutalized for years on end. She is determined to save even those who have been complicit with this evil out of fear or weakness—if, indeed, they can be saved. Strengthened by the bond she shares with her fellow warrior, Duncan, Fallon has already succeeded in rescuing countless shifters and elves and ordinary humans.

In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.” In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute. As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid power of It, The Institute is Stephen King’s gut-wrenchingly dramatic story of good vs. evil in a world where the good guys don’t always win.", "2019", "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RriuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", (SELECT author_id FROM author WHERE name = "Stephen King"), (SELECT publisher_id FROM publisher WHERE name = "Scribner"));

("The Son", "Soon to be a TV Series on AMC starring Pierce Brosnan and co-written by Philipp Meyer. Now in paperback, the critically acclaimed, New York Times bestselling epic, a saga of land, blood, and power that follows the rise of one unforgettable Texas family from the Comanche raids of the 1800s to the oil booms of the 20th century. Part epic of Texas, part classic coming-of-age story, part unflinching examination of the bloody price of power, The Son is a gripping and utterly transporting novel that maps the legacy of violence in the American west with rare emotional acuity, even as it presents an intimate portrait of one family across two centuries. Eli McCullough is just twelve-years-old when a marauding band of Comanche storm his Texas homestead and brutally murder his mother and sister, taking him as a captive. Despite their torture and cruelty, Eli--against all odds--adapts to life with the Comanche, learning their ways, their language, taking on a new name, finding a place as the adopted son of the chief of the band, and fighting their wars against not only other Indians, but white men, too-complicating his sense of loyalty, his promised vengeance, and his very understanding of self. But when disease, starvation, and westward expansion finally decimate the Comanche, Eli is left alone in a world in which he belongs nowhere, neither white nor Indian, civilized or fully wild. Deftly interweaving Eli’s story with those of his son, Peter, and his great-granddaughter, JA, The Son deftly explores the legacy of Eli’s ruthlessness, his drive to power, and his life-long status as an outsider, even as the McCullough family rises to become one of the richest in Texas, a ranching-and-oil dynasty of unsurpassed wealth and privilege. Harrowing, panoramic, and deeply evocative, The Son is a fully realized masterwork in the greatest tradition of the American canon-an unforgettable novel that combines the narrative prowess of Larry McMurtry with the knife edge sharpness of Cormac McCarthy.", "2013", "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xca9cCLGGswC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", (SELECT author_id FROM author WHERE name = "Philipp Meyer"), (SELECT publisher_id FROM publisher WHERE name = "Harper Collins"));

Autant la phénoménologie comme telle s'occupe des phénomènes en leur statut transcendantal, autant la précision qui leur est apportée par la prise en compte de leur dimension imaginative et affective, conduit-elle à délimiter, à l'intérieur de la phénoménologie, le champ de l'anthropologie phénoménologique.

Voyage long, difficile, aventureux où l'énigme reste entière mais a changé de visage. Alors qu'il y a quelque chose de non humain dans la rationalité, et qui a tant séduit la tradition philosophique, dans le champ qui se découvre ici, l'imagination, dans ses rapports complexes avec l'affectivité, paraît, en écho à Nietzsche, humaine, trop humaine. Lieu d'illusions multiples, affectives, mais aussi axiologiques, au plus loin de toute idéologie et de toute évaluation, toutes deux ratiocinantes, au plus près d'une reprise lucide des horizons symboliques de l'institution symbolique dans laquelle nous vivons et qui nous fait vivre. La question est peut-être finalement: qu'est-ce que vivre, et vivre humainement ? Vivre, et non pas être ?", "2004", "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4Y_1pRPw2w8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", (SELECT author_id FROM author WHERE name = "Marc Richir"), (SELECT publisher_id FROM publisher WHERE name = "Editions Jérôme Millon"));

Ariel sabe que los ejemplares de la obra de Lumas, un escritor científico victoriano, son extremadamente raros, y según dicen algunos, están malditos. Saul Burlem, el director de su tesis, ha desaparecido y nadie sabe dónde está.
